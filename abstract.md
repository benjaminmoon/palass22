title: "Were there multiple bursts in the early evolution of Ichthyosauromorpha?"
---

Ichthyosauromorpha were among the first Mesozoic reptile clades to invade the oceans after the end-Permian mass extinction (EPME). Their rapid transition has been identified as an 'early burst' in recent studies of cladistic disparity and body size, with taxa over 10 m occurring within 7 Ma of the EPME and 3 Ma of the first ichthyosauromorph fossils. Here, I use a newly-curated database of Ichthyosauromorpha occurrences — supplementing the Palaeobiology Database — to explore their diversification. Occurrence ranges were restricted, where possible, to substage or biozone, standardized to Geologic Time Scale 2020 ages. Two peaks of diversity in the Olenekian and Anisian are preceded by high rates of cladogenesis in time-calibrated phylogenies, and separated by a distinct drop in diversity. Estimates of diversification from PyRate show multiple early bursts in speciation timing, however, they suggest initial high diversification rates increase to a single peak in the latest Olenekian with a decrease through the Middle Triassic. Effects of these differences on rates of trait evolution will be explored. Focus on temporally and spatially restricted Lagerstätten leads to a bonanza effect and multiple diversity peaks, while much interim ichthyosauromorph diversity was likely present in nonpreserved or undersampled deep water environments.
